The resource protocol uses double-layer encryption: the resource data is Token-encrypted first, then each part is Token-encrypted again by the link layer. On receive, the link layer strips the outer encryption, and the resource assembly strips the inner encryption. This message is repeated to ensure we test multi-part resources."
